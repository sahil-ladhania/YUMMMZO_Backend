# Routes

This folder defines all API routes for the backend.

## Structure:
- Each file maps to specific resource routes (e.g., `userRoutes.js`, `orderRoutes.js`).
- The routes link to the controllers to handle incoming requests and responses.

## Example:
- **userRoutes.js**: Defines routes like `/register`, `/login`, `/profile`.
- **orderRoutes.js**: Contains order-related routes like `/orders`, `/order/:id`.

## API Documentation:
- Detailed API endpoints are available in the main README file or separate API documentation.
